/// This is a push, not a pull. Owning the framing means a chunk can simply be sent - build
/// <c>[0x00][varint length][payload]</c> and hand it to the QUIC stream - with no data-reader
/// callback to answer, nothing to defer, and no buffer whose lifetime a library dictates. QUIC
/// streams are independent, so nothing has to be interleaved with other responses either.
///
/// It is an <see cref="IBufferWriter{T}"/> on purpose: that is the shape a serializer, a file
/// copy or a framework's response sink already writes into, so streaming through it needs no
/// adapter.
///
/// Backpressure is the connection's send retention. <see cref="FlushAsync"/> returns once the
/// chunk is queued, and waits when the connection is at its high-water, so a producer cannot
/// outrun a peer that has stopped reading.
